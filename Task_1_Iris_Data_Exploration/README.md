Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing the Iris Dataset

Objective
	Explore and understand the Iris dataset using pandas and visualize its features using seaborn and matplotlib.

Dataset
Source: Loaded using `seaborn.load_dataset('iris')`
Features:
  sepal_length (cm)
  sepal_width (cm)
  petal_length (cm)
  petal_width (cm)
  species (setosa, versicolor, virginica)

Tools Used
	Python
	pandas
	matplotlib
	seaborn
	Jupyter Notebook

What I Did
	Loaded the dataset using seaborn
	Explored dataset using head(),info(),describe()
Visulization:
	Scatter plots to compare sepal and petal lengths
	Histograms to show value distributions
	Box plots to identify outliers
	Analyzed how species differ based on features

Insights:
	Find outliers after visualizing box plot and find some outliers
	Find how many values are repeated in the attribute through binning	

Conclusion
	This task helped me understand data loading, inspection, and visualization. It gave me a solid foundation for performing EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) in future ML tasks.
